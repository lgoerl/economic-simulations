Time

What is time? 
That depends on what your perspective is. What drives your system? 

We need a force that stirs the pot. We need it to be cyclical, but its effects random-ish. 

What's in the pot? 
	Short answer: a bunch of shit that reacts together?
	Long answer: a solution of solutions, each acted upon by The Force, by their own collective mass, and by the energy of the past, insulated by -again- their own collective mass.  
	Somehow, fueled by the energy of the stirring, and the pot, they create something greater than their parts. 

	The human brain is just another example, perfect insulation for capturing the energy in the chaos of human life, it creates something new. 

Some rules that dictate how compounds form must exist.
