# Notes

## Patterns

### In Society
- creation of new technology
- improving efficiency of existing technology
- inheritance of wealth
- "inheritance" of behavior/knowledge
- **establishment** and recognition of authority

### Morality/Moral games
- ultimatum game
    - Experimenter gives the first player an endowment, who then decides how to divide the sum between theirself and the other player - typically with the stipulation that their exists some minimum split value. The second player then decides whether to accept or reject the offer: if the offer is accepted, then the endowment is split as proposed, otherwise neither player gets anything. 
    - It's interesting to note that the "rational" choice by player two in this game is to accept any offer. 
- dictator game
    - Experimenter gives the dictator an endowment, and the dictator decides how to split the endowment among the other players
    - It's possible that this game requires the dictator to be aware of additional concepts to split the endowment fairly. 
- public goods game
    - Players of the game secretly choose how many of their private tokens to put into a public pot. The tokens in this pot are multiplied by a factor (greater than one and less than the number of players, N) and this "public good" payoff is evenly divided among players. Each subject also keeps the tokens they do not contribute.
    - Variants
        - iterated pg: it's been observed that over time the players tend to offer fewer tokens. (trust, free-riders)
        - open pg: full transparency. Often, the contributions to the pot are significantly higher overall.
        - punishment and/or rewards pg: "completely different" methods for enforcing cooporation and higher payoffs. keep in mind punishment is costly. 
- milgram experiment
    - participant agrees to administer electric shocks to someone they believe is taking an examination administered by the exerimentor. 
    - tests iteractions with authority with horrifying results
- stanford prison experiment
    - prisoners and guards battle it out to see who is king of the prison yard!!!!!
    - haha jk it's always the guards
    - 
- (in)justice and revenge?

## The Rich Fucking Everything Up
What we really mean here is that powerful individuals and orgainizations will "often" sieze the means of production - whatever they happen to be - and funnel the wealth towards themselves. 

## Layers
- biological / genetic
- set base behaviors
- adaptive behaviors

It's possible that the previous two layers are the same. Consider the possibility that "set" behaviors were adapted at some point, and are continually used. The body/other behavioral systems/networks depend on this behavior and it's consistency/predictability. Or, said another way, they adapt to it - they develop around it. Also consider the biological example of the musculature system: muscle groups get rewarded for being continually used, with more oxygen and nutrients to further develop and sustain contraction in different ways.
